## Are you becoming overwhelmed by the amount of emails that you receive in a typical day?

## Do you use Gmail (or G Suite) ?

Then I have the perfect solution for you!

### The service is called [Adio.ai](https://adios.ai/ "Adios.ai")

#### Basically to sum up how the service works in one sentence.

Once you click the **ðŸš€Get Started** link on the homepage, it will ask you to link your Gmail or G Suite account to the 3rd-party application. Afterwards, you'll be brought to a screen asking you to asking you to choose times each day to receive emails in full digests at the times of your choosing. For example I have it set for 12:00 PM and 8:00 PM doing this allows me to receive email notifications only twice a day! (huge relief)

#### Worried about missing an important email?

If you're worried about missing an important email that a friend or boss sent? No worries here, simply use the Adios Stashed Email tab inside of your inbox to access your queued emails before they're delivered to your main inbox.

## Verdict?

I think this is a pretty great product, and it's free to use at the time of this email. I've been using it for well over a year and love not be bombarded by useless newsletter email notifications every 5 seconds.
