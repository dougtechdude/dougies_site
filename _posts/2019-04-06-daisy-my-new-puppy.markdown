## Disclosure

I haven't wrote a good ol' fashioned blog post in quite some time, and just wanted to test my chops again.

**Also..** I'm sad to announce that Daisy has been diagnosed with the [parvovirus](http://urlsec.io/\~https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/what-every-puppy-owner-needs-to-know-about-parvo-in-puppies/ "Read more about the Parvovirus in puppies here"), [hookworms](http://urlsec.io/\~https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/understanding-hookworms-in-dogs/ "Read more about hookworms in dogs here"), and [roundworms](http://urlsec.io/\~https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/roundworms-in-dogs-symptoms-treatment-and-prevention/ "Read more about roundworms in dogs here") after I took her to her first vet visit. :triumph: :worried: The vet told us that the virus is in the very early stages, and can be treatable if dealt with appropriately. Daisy has around a 62% - 90% chance of beating this nasty parvovirus and becomming a normal healthy puppy. I'm now at the point where I'm administering medication to her daily, while also watching her behavior to see if there are any changes. I'm remaining hopeful that she beats this, because she is a sweet creature, and loves to cuddle. It makes me happy to see her happy.

Thanks for reading, I really appreciate it! :blush:

I'm not asking for any donations for Daisy or her care. But would ask, if you've made it this far in the post could you post a picture of your favorite companion? This would help making me feel a lot better, and hopeful for Daisy's future. Thank you. :heart:
